#0x12. C - Singly linked lists

Linked lists in C are among the simplest and most common linear data structures. A linked list is a series of connected objects called nodes whose order isn’t provided by their physical positioning in memory. Instead, every node points to the other. Every node contains two fields, i.e., data and an address (in different phrases, a link) to the next node and forms a chain. Linked Lists are used to create trees and graphs. The last node contains a pointer to the null. The size of the linked list not fix. The structure allows for efficient removal or insertion of the node from any place in the sequence through iteration.

The linked list is usually considered as an example of a dynamic memory allocation. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear. Faster access, such as random access, isn’t feasible. The Linked List is similar to an array; however, it isn’t stored sequentially in the memory, unlike an array. Arrays have improved cache locality compared to linked lists.
